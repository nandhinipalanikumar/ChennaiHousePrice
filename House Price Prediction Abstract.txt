	The real estate market in Chennai has witnessed a steady growth over the years due to factors such as rapid urbanization, a thriving IT industry, and increasing investment opportunities. As a result, the demand for houses in Chennai has risen significantly, leading to a surge in housing prices.
	According to recent reports, the average price of a residential property in Chennai is around Rs. 5,400 per square foot. However, the prices vary depending on the location, size, and amenities of the property. Given the high demand for houses in Chennai and the fluctuating prices, accurate prediction of house prices can be beneficial for both buyers and sellers. This project aims to use data science techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in Chennai and help stakeholders make informed decisions.
	In this project, we aimed to predict house prices using data science techniques and machine learning algorithms. We collected data on various features such as location, size, and amenities of houses in a specific region, and performed exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and identify any outliers. We then pre-processed the data by handling missing values, scaling the numerical features, and encoding the categorical features.
	Next, we applied different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree, and random forest to train models and predict house prices. We evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared value. After comparing the results, we selected the best-performing model and used it to make predictions on new data.
	Our project resulted in a successful house price prediction model that can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions. The accuracy of the model suggests that it can be used as a reliable tool in real estate, and the techniques used in the project can be extended to other prediction problems as well.
	Using the model, we created a webpage using flask framework, in which attributes such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, area type, etc., has to be selected by the user and estimated price is predicted succesfully.
